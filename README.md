# MetroPhoneLauncher (MPL)

MPL (MetroPhoneLauncher, MPLaucnher) is a launcher that looks as much like Windows Phone 8 as possible (not so much now). Feel the WP experience on your device right now. Free.

Since the launcher isn't ready yet, I can't show a huge list of functionality, but you can already see it:

- A design as similar as possible to the original Windows Phone.

- 20 different colors so you can make your device the most unique and unusual.

- Light and dark theme to save your battery and eyes at night =)

- Unique desktop - customize it the way you want. Make tiles bigger, wider, smaller, move and do whatever you want.

- Lots of customizations to make the launcher perfect

- Ability to receive "Over-The-Air" updates

- Working app search.

And much more...
