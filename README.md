# MetroPhoneLauncher (MPL)

MPL (MetroPhoneLauncher, MPLaucnher) is an Android launcher that looks like Windows Phone 8.

*Don't be lazy and send all possible ideas/errors to my email or to our Telegram group*

MPL is still in development, but it already has a lot of useful features that you might like. Here's what's already available:

- A design as similar as possible to the original Windows Phone.
- Animations that are as similar to Windows Phone animations as possible.
- 20 different colors so you can make your device the most unique and unusual.
- Light and dark theme to save your battery and eyes at night =)
- Unique desktop - customize it the way you want. Make tiles bigger, wider, smaller, move and do whatever you want.
- Lots of customizations to make the launcher perfect
- Ability to receive "Over-The-Air" updates
- Support icon packs to make icons prettier 
- Monet (Dynamic Colors) support

And a lot of other, smaller things!

**It will be very soon:**
- [ ] Live tiles.
