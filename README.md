# MetroPhoneLauncher (MPL)

MPL (MetroPhoneLauncher, MPLaucnher) is an Android launcher that looks like Windows Phone 8.

*If you want to use it on your real device as your default launcher, then be prepared for possible bugs (including critical ones). Don't be lazy and send all possible ideas/errors to my email or to our Telegram group*

MPL isn't ready yet, but it already has some cool features you might like. See what's currently available:

- A design as similar as possible to the original Windows Phone.
- 20 different colors so you can make your device the most unique and unusual.
- Unique desktop - customize it the way you want. Make tiles bigger, wider, smaller, move and do whatever you want.
- Light and dark theme to save your battery and eyes at night =)
- Lots of customizations to make the launcher perfect
- Ability to receive "Over-The-Air" updates
- Support icon packs to make icons prettier 
- Monet (Dynamic Colors) support
- Animations that are as similar to Windows Phone animations as possible.

And much more...

**It will be very soon:**
- [ ] Live tiles.
